Description: An interactive mapping tool for geographically weighted correlation and partial correlation. Geographically weighted partial correlation coefficients are calculated following Percival and Tsutsumida (2017) <doi: 10.1553/giscience2017_01_s36> and are described in greater detail in Percival et al. (2021) <arXiv: 2101.03491> as well as Tsutsumida et al. (2019) <doi: 10.5194/ica-abs-1-372-2019>.
